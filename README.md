# CFT
Circuit Fault Tester -> This tool will process a netlist, find and optimize the faults in the netlist.

### What is CFT?
Circuit Fault Tester is a tool used to parse a netlist file and perform fault optimizations. This tool is developed as a part of my elective course - "Testing of Digital Circuits". **It is an educational tool.**

### Checklist
1. Fault equivalence operation with collapse ratio.
2. Fault dominance operation with collapse ratio.
